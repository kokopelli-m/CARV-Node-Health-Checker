# CARV Node Health Checker - Web3 Dashboard


Live Demo: https://carv-node-health-watch.lovable.app/

## 🚀 Introduction

**CARV Node Health Checker** is a simple, real-time monitoring dashboard for CARV Protocol Verifier Nodes operators.

CARV is the largest modular data layer for gaming and AI, where community-run **Verifier Nodes** play a critical role in decentralizing the network by validating TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) attestations on-chain, ensuring data privacy and protocol integrity.

This dashboard allows node operators (or anyone) to quickly check the health and status of their CARV Verifier Node(s) without needing to parse logs or query the blockchain manually.

## ✨ Features

- Uptime monitoring & historical participation rate
- Reward eligibility indicators
- Key metrics: last attestation time, signed blocks, participation score, etc.
- Simple wallet address or node ID input
- Clean, responsive Web3-themed UI
- No backend required – queries directly from CARV's public APIs and on-chain data
- Dark mode friendly
